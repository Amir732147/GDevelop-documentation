# GDevelop Credits

The GDevelop Credits System is an in-app currency that enhances your experience across the GDevelop game engine, by giving access to premium features and services.
Credits can be purchased and utilized on any platform, whether on the web, desktop, or mobile devices.

When credits are acquired, they are closely tied to your GDevelop account, ensuring a seamless and secure transaction experience. Your account serves as a centralized hub for managing and tracking your credit balance.
